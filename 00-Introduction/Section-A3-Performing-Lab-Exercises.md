## Performing Lab Exercises üöÄ

Lab exercises are at the heart of this course. They allow you to apply theoretical knowledge in a controlled, practical setting.

### Lab Exercise Workflow
1. **Preparation:**  
   - Run the lab command from the workstation to prepare the environment.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     [student@workstation ~]$ lab Tab Tab
     ```
     *This lists available exercises such as `administer-users`, `instances-cli`, and `deploy-overcloud-lab`.*

2. **Types of Exercises:**  
   - **Guided Exercises:** Follow the course narrative and perform practical tasks.
   - **End-of-Chapter Labs:** Gradable exercises designed to verify your learning outcomes.

3. **Exercise Actions:**  
   Each lab exercise script supports specific actions:
   - **start:** Initializes the exercise, verifies prerequisites, and sets up required resources.
   - **grade:** (For gradable labs) Checks the completion and correctness of each task.
   - **finish:** Cleans up the environment by deleting resources no longer needed.

   **Example Command:**
   ```bash
   [student@workstation ~]$ lab instances-cli start
   ```

### Refreshing Lab Scripts
- Use the `--refresh` option to delete current exercise scripts so that updated versions can be downloaded:
  ```bash
  [student@workstation ~]$ lab --refresh
  ```

## Troubleshooting & Log Analysis üìù

Effective troubleshooting is crucial when working with lab scripts and real-world systems.

### Log Files Overview
- **Script Downloads:**  
  Lab scripts are downloaded from a centralized classroom server. They reside in `/usr/local/lib` after the first run.
- **Log File Locations:**  
  - **Standard Output:** Logs normal output messages in `/var/tmp/labs/<exercise>`.
  - **Error Log:** Contains error messages in `/var/tmp/labs/<exercise>.err`.
  
  **Example Directory Listing:**
  ```bash
  [student@workstation ~]$ ls -l /var/tmp/labs
  -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   113 May  9 23:38 instances-cli
  -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   113 May  9 23:38 instances-cli.err
  ```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Review Logs:** Start with the error log to diagnose problems.
- **Command Output:** Verify the output against expected results from the course material.
- **System Logs:** If needed, log into the target systems and check local logs for additional context.
