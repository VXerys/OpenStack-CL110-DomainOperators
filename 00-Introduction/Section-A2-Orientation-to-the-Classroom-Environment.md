## Introduction & Orientation

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f3180c1-42a0-49bb-9278-c7a598d7e36c)

Welcome to the journey of mastering OpenStack administration!  
In this course, we delve into the domain of managing and operating OpenStack environments. The course begins with an **orientation to the classroom environment**, ensuring that you understand the roles of different virtual machines (VMs) and how to interact with them using both graphical and command-line interfaces.

- **Objective:**  
  Understand the operational landscape of a classroom-based OpenStack deployment and learn how to leverage the provided tools effectively.
- **Focus Areas:**  
  - **Domain Operations:** Managing overcloud and undercloud nodes.
  - **Lab Exercises:** Hands-on practice using the workstation as a central access point.
  - **Guided Exercises:** Step-by-step walkthroughs on launching instances, configuring networks, and managing storage.

## Classroom Environment Overview

This section provides an overview of the classroom setup used throughout the course. The environment is meticulously designed for hands-on activities and real-world simulation.

### Environment Layout
- **Primary Workstation:**  
  The only VM with a graphical desktop, required for using a browser and accessing remote dashboards and GUI tools.
- **Network Configuration:**  
  - **External Network:** `172.25.250.0/24` with a gateway at `172.25.250.254`.
  - **Internal Networks:** Overcloud VMs use multiple VLANs with `172.24.X.0/24` addressing.
- **Additional VMs:**  
  Include nodes such as `controller0`, `compute0`, `compute1`, `computehci0`, and `ceph0`â€”each playing a distinct role within the overcloud domain.

### Classroom Diagram Reference
A network topology diagram (e.g., Figure 0.2 in course materials) provides a visual layout of the environment. It is recommended to print or save this diagram for ongoing reference.

## Managing OpenStack Overclouds

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dccd8df4-095e-491b-ada1-ae950b9d1f07)

Managing the overcloud in a classroom setting is a distinct process from production environments. This section covers the operational practices for maintaining overcloud clusters.

### Key Considerations
- **Cluster Dynamics:**  
  The overcloud consists of multiple nodes (controller, compute, storage) that must operate in unison. Resetting a single node might disrupt cluster communications.
- **Group Resets:**  
  For exercises involving the overcloud, always reset nodes as a group to ensure all dependencies are maintained.
- **Production vs. Classroom:**  
  Classroom environments are scaled-down versions with some shortcuts; always refer to the official documentation for production procedures.

> **Warning:** Never reset critical nodes like the power node in an online environment as it can lead to loss of management credentials.

## Controlling Your Systems

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1175337f-ce44-426f-9eae-a1df3a3ce2e3)

This section provides guidance on managing the state of your VMs through the web-based control panel provided in the classroom environment.

### VM States & Actions

#### **VM States**
- **Building:** The VM is in the process of being created.
- **Active:** The VM is running and available.
- **Stopped:** The VM is shut down but retains disk data.

#### **Actions**
- **CREATE / DELETE:** Provision or remove the classroom environment.
- **START / STOP:** Power on or shut down VMs.
- **OPEN CONSOLE:** Access the VMâ€™s console in a new browser tab for direct login and command execution.
- **ACTION â†’ Reset:** Reset a VM to its initial state. Use with caution as disk contents will be lost.

## Resetting Your Classroom Environment

Resetting your classroom environment is a key part of ensuring a clean slate for repeated lab exercises.

### Reset Procedures
- **Individual Node Reset:**  
  Use when instructed to reset a specific VM (e.g., workstation, compute node).
- **Overcloud Reset:**  
  Requires resetting all nodes in the overcloud together to avoid disrupting the cluster state.
- **Full Environment Reset:**  
  The DELETE and CREATE functions allow you to completely rebuild the classroom environment.

> **Important:** The DELETE operation is irreversible. Ensure that any critical work is saved externally before proceeding.

## Practical Exercises & Lab Walkthroughs ðŸš€

This section details the step-by-step lab exercises and guided activities that reinforce theoretical concepts with hands-on practice.

### Sample Lab Exercise: Launching an Instance
1. **Objective:**  
   Launch a new compute instance using the dashboard.
2. **Steps:**
   - **Login:** Start at the workstation VM.
   - **Access Dashboard:** Open your browser and navigate to the RHOSP dashboard.
   - **Create Instance:** Follow the guided steps, selecting the desired image and flavor.
   - **Verification:** Use SSH from the workstation to connect to the new instance.
3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```bash
   # Launch an instance using the CLI
   openstack server create --flavor m1.small --image cirros --network private-net instance1
   ```
4. **Inline Commentary:**  
   - The command above demonstrates a typical CLI-based instance launch.
   - Ensure that network configurations match your environment's setup.

### Additional Exercises
- **Network Configuration:** Set up and test internal and external network connectivity.
- **Storage Management:** Configure and test various storage options such as persistent and ephemeral storage.
- **Automation:** Explore automating deployments using tools like Cloud-init.
